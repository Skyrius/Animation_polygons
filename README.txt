My animation is a short about a bird who doesn't fly very well and has a fear of heights, 
but after being stuck watching all the other birds fly freely, decides to take a leap of
faith.

The polygonal object I created is the pyramid (5 sided, the roof of the house), the 
hierarchical object is the bird (not the flying ones, but the main character bird;
the wings rotate around the body which rotates around the head) and the texture mapped
objects include the house, ground and tree.

The only files I changed in the original template were anim.cpp, Shapes.c, Shapes.h and
the vector and fragment shaders. All other files should be the same. There are three .tga
files the animation needs that I've put in the project directory as well (where all the 
c files are), leaf-texture.tga, grass-texture.tga and stone-texture.tga. The folder includes
all the files needed for the program, including the ones from the template I didn't change,
just in case. 

Self-grading:
Two-level hierarchical object: 3 - I only employed a two level hiearchy in animating the bird
for a few scenes, not all of them since it made some movements too complicated

At least one texture: 4

360 degree camera fly-around using LookAt: 4

At least one polygonal object: 6 - I adjusted the vertex and fragment shader a little to get
a less "shiny" reflection, but it still uses phong-shading

Real-time speed: 2

Display fram rate of your program: 2 - the frame rate is displayed in the output console 
(printf statement) The average frame rate is somewhere between 30-50 depending on your
computer speed

Submit a movie of your animation: 2

Creativity: 3 - not the most creative story, but I spent quite a bit of time picking colors
and adjusting lighting and textures

Complexity: 2 - not much complexity in terms of animation, but it wasn't a very long
clip

Overall quality: 3 - I ran short on time since textures weren't working on SeasNet (what I
normally work from since my computer doesn't run the template properly) so the video
isn't as polished or complex as I would like, but I still think I did relatively well
despite coding blind for part of it.
